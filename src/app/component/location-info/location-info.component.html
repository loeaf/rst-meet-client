<h2>Rhinoceros</h2>
<p>The rhinoceros gets its name from one of its most notable features: its horns. The word rhinoceros come from the Greek words rhino meaning “nose” and ceros meaning “horn.” The number of horns that a rhino has varies on the species. The two African species (the black rhino and the white rhino) and the Sumatran rhino have two horns, while the Javan rhino and one-horned rhino have one horn.</p>
